This is the homepage of YanuX Framework, a novel framework for developing multi-device applications.

The framework is comprised of the following components:
- [__YanuX Auth__](https://github.com/YanuX-Framework/YanuX-Auth)
- [__YanuX Broker__](https://github.com/YanuX-Framework/YanuX-Broker) [\[REST API Documentation\]](YanuX-Broker)
- [__YanuX Coordinator__](https://github.com/YanuX-Framework/YanuX-Broker) [\[JavaScript/TypeScript API Documentation\]](YanuX-Coordinator)
- [__YanuX IPS Bridge__](https://github.com/YanuX-Framework/YanuX-IPSBridge)
- __YanuX Orchestrator__
     - [__Android__](https://github.com/YanuX-Framework/YanuX-Scavenger)
          - Requires Android 6.0 (tested up to Android 10)
          - It also includes some early indoor positioning experiments
     - [__Desktop__](https://github.com/YanuX-Framework/YanuX-DesktopClient)
          - Tested on GNU/Linux but it should also work on Windows and macOS.
          - Currently this CLI application also incorporates the desktop version of the __Indoor Positioning Client__.

Basides the framework itself, we have developed an indoor positioning solution comprised of:
- [__Indoor Positioning Server__](https://github.com/YanuX-Framework/YanuX-IPSServer)
- __Indoor Positioning Clients__:
     - [__Android__](https://github.com/YanuX-Framework/YanuX-AndroidIPSApp)
          - Requires Android 6.0 (tested up to Android 10)
     - [__Desktop__](https://github.com/YanuX-Framework/YanuX-DesktopClient)
          - Tested on GNU/Linux but it should also work on Windows and macOS.
          - Currently this CLI application also incorporates the desktop version of the __YanuX Orchestrator__ component.

You can also find the following demo applications and prototypes:
